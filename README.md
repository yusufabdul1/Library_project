# Library Management System - CLI Application

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing a library system. The system allows the user to manage authors and books using Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) methods. It includes functionality for adding, deleting, displaying, and searching authors and books, as well as associating books with authors in a one-to-many relationship.
